        <p>Olive the Movie is the first full length feature film shot completely on a smart phone. A 35 mm lens adapter was fabricated to fit the smart phone in
        order to achieve a shallow depth of field. The film stars two time Academy Award nominated actress Gena Rowlands. The film simply put is about a little
        girl that goes into the lives of 3 people, and old lonely woman, a foreigner having a hard time acclimating in the United States, and an obese man&hellip; and transforms their lives without saying one word!
        </p>
        <p>The financing of Olive was done independently of any corporation. The goal now is to be the first film to not only be shot on a cell phone but to also be the 1st independently financed feature film on 2000 theaters across the United States without the backing of a Major Studio.
